# Grafici-GFX
Grafici GFX is a data plotting library for Adafruit GFX graphic libraries. 
This modular library allows you to easily manage and plot data on any arduino display/lcd supporting the Adafruit GFX library.

## Testing

### Unit testing
The library unit tests resides in the [Grafici-TEST](https://github.com/cattanimarco/Grafici-Test) repository.
### System testing
All examples are tested on `Arduino UNO R4 Minima` with the `Adafruit 2.8" TFT Touch Shield ` shield. It is possible that on older arduinos some examples exceed the device total memory.
